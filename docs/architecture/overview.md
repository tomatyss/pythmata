# Pythmata Architecture Overview

## Introduction

Pythmata is a Python-based BPMN workflow engine designed to provide robust process automation capabilities with a modern React frontend. This document outlines the high-level architecture, core components, and key design decisions.

## Core Components

### 1. BPMN Engine
- **Parser & Validator**: XML schema validation with custom extension support
- **Execution Engine**: Token-based process execution
- **State Management**: Redis-backed persistence with transaction support
- **Event System**: Comprehensive BPMN event handling
- **Timer System**: [Robust timer event scheduling and execution](timer-event-system.md)

### 2. Frontend Application
- **Process Designer**: Visual BPMN modeling interface
- **Process Monitor**: Real-time instance monitoring
- **Task Management**: User task handling and forms
- **Admin Interface**: Process and instance management

### 3. Backend Services
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints with FastAPI
- **Process Service**: Process definition management
- **Instance Service**: Process instance execution
- **Task Service**: Task management and assignment

### 4. Connection Management
- **Base Connection Manager**: Common connection lifecycle handling
  - State tracking
  - Automatic reconnection
  - Error handling and recovery
- **Service-Specific Implementations**:
  - Database connections with connection pooling
  - Redis state management connections
  - RabbitMQ event system connections

### 5. Storage Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Process definitions and instance data
- **Redis**: State management and caching
- **RabbitMQ**: Event handling and message queues

## Key Features

### Process Execution
- Token-based execution model
- Subprocess and call activity support
- Multi-instance activities
- Transaction management
- Compensation handling

### State Management
- Distributed state tracking
- Variable scoping
- Token lifecycle management
- Transaction boundaries
- Event correlation

### Integration Capabilities
- External service tasks
- Message correlation
- Timer events
- Signal handling
- Error management

## Design Decisions

### 1. Token-Based Execution
- Enables precise process state tracking
- Supports parallel execution paths
- Facilitates transaction management
- Enables state persistence and recovery

### 2. Connection Management Pattern
- **Unified Connection Interface**: Common connection lifecycle across services
- **State Management**: Accurate tracking of connection states
- **Automatic Recovery**: Built-in reconnection for transient failures
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error propagation and recovery
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and disposal of connections

### 3. Redis State Management
- Fast in-memory state access
- Built-in pub/sub for events
- Atomic operations for consistency
- Distributed locking support

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- Loose coupling between components
- Scalable message processing
- Asynchronous execution support
- Real-time updates

### 4. Modern Frontend Stack
- React for component-based UI
- TypeScript for type safety
- Material-UI for consistent design
- WebSocket for real-time updates

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Process-level permissions
- API security measures

### Data Protection
- Secure variable handling
- Encrypted connections
- Audit logging
- Access controls

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support
- Load balancing ready
- Distributed state management
- Event-driven architecture

### Optimization
- Redis caching
- Efficient token management
- Query optimization
- Resource pooling

## Deployment Architecture

### Container-Based Deployment
